.SYNOPSIS
	Generates a self-signed code-signing certificate for signing the EXOKit MSIX package,
	and exports it as a base64-encoded PFX string suitable for a GitHub Actions secret.

.DESCRIPTION
	Run this ONCE to create the signing certificate used by the GitHub Actions release workflow.
	The certificate Subject must match the Publisher value in Package.appxmanifest (CN=CKH-RCIT).

	After running this script:
	  1. Copy the contents of "signing-cert-base64.txt" and save it as a GitHub Actions secret
		 named PACKAGE_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions).
	  2. Save the password you choose below as a second secret named PACKAGE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD.
	  3. Keep "EXOKitSigning.pfx" somewhere safe (or delete it once the secrets are saved -
		 it is not needed locally afterward).
	  4. Distribute "EXOKitSigning.cer" (the public certificate, no private key) to anyone who
		 needs to install the MSIX, so they can add it to their Trusted People store.

.NOTES
	This certificate is for internal/sideload distribution only. It will show a warning the first
	time a user installs the MSIX unless the .cer has been imported into their certificate store.
